# Preferences for Axel Wahlstrom

1. __Is it generally easier to reach you by text, electronic mail, voice mail or something else?  What hours?__ 
It is generally easier to reach me by text at any time and I will try my best to respond in a timely matter between 7AM and 12AM

1. __What are your expectations about what your team will accomplish this semester?__ 
I expect our team to complete a somewhat polished working build by the end of the semester and gain the skills that are under high demand in
the industry.

1. __What are your personal goals for improving your teamwork and communication skills this semester?__ 
I am more of a self-identified introvert so I want to improve my leadership and communication skills by helping a significant amount
in team planning and scheduling.

1. __What kinds of obstacles might you encounter in trying to reach both your team and personal goals?__ 
I think time is the largest obstacle we might encounter. I expect to put in a lot of hours into this class but I expect it to pay off.
As long as our team is dilligent and has good work ethic, then we can accomplish anything.

1. __What happens if some people on the team want to get an “A” while others think a “B” will be acceptable?__ 
It could give rise to someone not wanting to put in the extra effort and contributing as much as the rest of the team when the end
of the semester approaches.

1. __Is it acceptable for some team members to do more work on the assignment in order to get an “A”?__ 
It depends how much work they have done so far. However, it is a team effort so one person trying to carry the team can lead to a lone-wolf.

1. __How much time per week do you anticipate it will take to make the project successful?__ 
I would say it will take around 12 hours a week or so, give or take, to have a successful product.

1. __How will you decide who should do what on the project and activities?__
We will meet once or twice a week and figure out who will do what.

1. __What will happen if someone doesn’t follow through on a commitment (missing deadline, no show, etc.)?__
It can make our team suffer and cause our team to have to pick up the slack of the individual. if it is a persistent problem we will work
something out.

1. __What happens if people have different opinions on the quality of the work?__ 
It can cause a lot of problems and cause our group to "storm." It is not ideal but we can have team meetings and keep eachother accountable
on our team's quality standards.

1. __How will you deal with different work habits of team members?__
We can help keep eachother motivated to work as hard as we can. If not we can discuss whether or not their performance is a detriment to
our teamwork.

1. __Do you want to have a standing meeting time outside of class?__ 
yes.

1. __How often do you think the team will need to meet outside of class?__
We are going to try for once a week if not more.

1. __Will you need approval of every team member before making a decision?__ 
not every member. just one or two should suffice.

1. __What will you do if every team member except one agrees on something?__ 
We will come to a compromise or discuss the issue further.

1. __What will you do if one person seems to be dominating the team process?__
talk with them and tell them that is a group effort. and worse case, involve Dave.

1. __What will you do if you feel most of the facilitation responsibilities are falling on you?__ 
Discuss with the team first and then Dave if need be.
