## Review

#### Completed epics in Sprint Backlog 
* **Where Am I #17**: Where Am I was the most technically challenging Epic for our team to complete. We successfully implemented all of the tasks, we used the Mozilla Geolocation API to get geolocation information and binding the Navigator object to our Atlas. The user is zoomed into their location and can then freely move the cursor to see other coordinates across the world. Our "Where Am I?" button was made for mobile first and spans the entire bottom of our map making it a usable and ergonomic button for mobile use, that scales with larger screen sizes. This Epic gave our team a lot of experience better understanding GitHub ettiquette, Javascript, reactstrap, and leaflet.
* **Set Team Name #16**: Our team name is HughLit-PackHerd. We decided our team name should be a tongue-and-cheek pun of HP by phonetically spelling out Hewlett-Packard with different words, because of the irony that our instructor Dave Matthews had worked for them and we are now working for him. Our team logo is an upside down version of the new HP logo making it look like 'dq'.
* **About #23**: Our "About" page allowed us to continue to poke fun at HP, we modified HP's About page to fit the CS314 curriculum with some self deprecating humor to make fun of our teams coding skills. Our page was mainly designed to encourage learning how to develop with responsive web design in mind and dip our toes into reactstrap. Our bios were created to look good in both mobile, tablet and browser.

#### Incomplete epics in Sprint Backlog 
* **Where Is? #32**: Our team decided that enough work was needed to make our "Where Am I?" look and feel good for the user experience that we decided it would be more advantageous to fine tune the necessary Epic then work on, and potentially not finish this epic. When our team does get to this Epic we will follow the design philosophy we used for "Where Am I?" and make sure that it works well in mobile and implements all the tasks.
* **Server Support #38**: Server support was on the bottom of our backlog. We quickly realized into development of our "Where Am I?" Epic that we would not be able to get to this epic.
