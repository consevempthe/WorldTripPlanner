## Review

#### Completed epics in Sprint Backlog 
* **Where Am I #17**: Where Am I was the most technically challenging Epic for our team to complete. We successfully implemented all of the tasks, we used the Mozilla Geolocation API to get geolocation information and binding the Navigator object to our Atlas. The user is zoomed into their location and can then freely move the cursor to see other coordinates across the world. Our "Where Am I?" button was made for mobile first and spans the entire bottom of our map making it a usable and ergonomic button for mobile use, that scales with larger screen sizes. This Epic gave our team a lot of experience better understanding GitHub ettiquette, Javascript, reactstrap, and leaflet.
* **Set Team Name #16**: Our team name is Hugh-Lit Pack-Herd. We decided our team name should be a tongue-and-cheek pun of HP by phonetically spelling out Hewlett-Packard with different words, because of the irony that our instructor Dave Matthews had worked for them and we are now working for him. Our team logo is an upside down version of the new HP logo making it look like 'dq'.
* **About #23**: Our "About" page allowed us to continue to poke fun at HP, we modified HP's About page to fit the CS314 curriculum with some self-deprecating humor to make fun of our teams coding skills. Our page was mainly designed to encourage learning how to develop with responsive web design in mind and dip our toes into reactstrap. Our bios were created to look good in both mobile, tablet and browser.

#### Incomplete epics in Sprint Backlog 
* **Where Is? #32**: Our team decided that enough work was needed to make our "Where Am I?" look and feel good for the user experience that we decided it would be more advantageous to fine tune the necessary Epic then work on, and potentially not finish this epic. When our team does get to this Epic we will follow the design philosophy we used for "Where Am I?" and make sure that it works well in mobile and implements all the tasks.
* **Server Support #38**: Server support was on the bottom of our backlog. We quickly realized into development of our "Where Am I?" Epic that we would not be able to get to this epic.

#### What went well
* Our team worked well with each other and have definitely fit into the Forming stage of group development. We have gotten to know each other a little bit better and have communicated well with each other.
* The overall process of checking out branches and working on the project seperate from each other, each group member accomplished tasks, while learning about all the libraries and code we were given.
* The "About" epic as a whole went smoothly, as we were able to complete all of the tasks for this epic.
* We were able to reach our goal by implementing the "Where am I?" feature.
* Our team was able to meet in the CSB 120 lab often in order to assist each other in programming and other project logistics.

#### Problems encountered and resolutions
* We couldn't figure out how to post a form with valid coordinates.
* We couldn't figure out how to keep the marker centered at all times.
* We couldn't figure out how to apply the "geolocation" API to our application, until we read some documentation about Leaflet.
* We couldn't get our bio images to appear on the deployed site, turns out we were using absolute paths rather than relative paths

## Retrospective

#### What went well
* Overall our team dynamic worked out the best, since no one in the team was more experienced than the others we learned to work on equal footing and everyone carried their own weight.
* For this being our first sprint to work collaboratively on a project, our team work skills never became a problem. As a team, we have communicated effectively and thoroughly to ensure that everyone is one the same page.
* We managed to not break master.
#### Potential improvements
* Our group started actually working on the sprint probably half way into it and as such didn't complete all of the Epics that we thought we could. Starting earlier would either have let us finish all of our Epics or come out with an even more polished project.
* We didn't use the design.md file to its fullest ability, in terms of talking our way through how we were going to implement our sprint. Creating a meeting early on to at least develop a framework for our sprint would be beneficial.
* Our Map UI could use some improvements. Right now as it tends to be laggy when clicking on different locations.
#### What we will change next time
* We will start working on our sprint earlier, especially now that our team has a better understanding for the workflow necessary to complete this. Starting earlier could potentially allow for surplus time before the sprint due date, allowing
for more last-minute polishing if needed.
* We will try to meet more formally to create times where we can talk about the design of the project, or just talk overall about Epics that we are working on.
* Simplify tasks by breaking them apart into smaller segments.
* Utilize TA office hours more, as the time we have spent talking with a TA has been helpful.
